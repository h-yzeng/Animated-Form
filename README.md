This is my submission repository for Project 1 in the ITMD-362 Human-Computer Interaction and Web Design Course.

The goal of this project is to design a single-page design that features a sign-up process to get new users to join an email list about Food Secrets.
Along with the designing process, I would experiment with patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up to learn the "top culinary secrets" as a fictional newsletter. 

For this project:
- The entire project is written from scratch in vanilla HTML, CSS, and basic JS without any frameworks or pre-build code
- I utilized three media queries for mobile sizing and laptop sizing adjustments
- Applied design principles including typography, color, and material design
- Engaged in agile, iterative development, and documented with 35+ commits with informative comments
